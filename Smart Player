- In this code we make sure that the image is not being displayed, this cause the image display window to be
  the active window.
- First we will run a VLC player with the code running in the background.
- Then we run the code
- We use a variable pause to hold the states of the of the video.
- Note video has to be playing first because the initial state of “pause” is “False”
- The function tap_key(key) is used to simulate key presses
